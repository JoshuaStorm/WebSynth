# Contributing

We appreciate contributions and enjoy building upon the open-source community. 
If you would like to contribute:

  1. Please read the [style guide](https://github.com/JoshuaStorm/WebSynth/wiki/Style-Guide) before contributing.
  2. If you are unfamiliar with p5.js, you can find information on it [here](http://p5js.org/reference/). Most of what we use is with the [p5.sound libary](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound)
  3. Check out the current [issues](https://github.com/JoshuaStorm/WebSynth/issues). We keep the issues page updated with issues, enhancements, and core functionality to be added (labeled as `core`)
  4. Clone the repo, make a new branch, and be on your way!
  5. It is generally courteous to comment on the issue saying you'll tackle the issue so two people don't accidentally end up doing the same work over. This can also be a chance for you to ask a few questions: don't know some synthesis concept? Ask a few questions, worst case scenario we'll link you to some articles. Don't know promises? We might advise you do another issue that is more in line with your experience, but we certainly won't leave you without some sort of learning resource.
  6. Once you submit a pull request, one of the two primary contributers (@JoshuaStorm and @KyleNehman) should review it within a day or so. If you are feeling a bit impatient and it is taking us awhile to get to your pull request, feel free to ping us again.

**We are all learning**: We want to encourage users to contribute at all levels of experience. All of us are learning, we hope this encourages you. Our code reviews will be us reviewing _your code_. Your code is not always reflective of you as a person, developer, or engineer. However, we also hope you have the opportunity to write code you are proud of.
